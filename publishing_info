Once you select the pokemon, you can interact by saying "Hello" or see it's level by "Level". You can play a simple game saying "Play" to start a game which will allow you to level up the pokemon.

Choose your favorite pokemon and go on a journey, level up your pokemon and teach them cool new tricks!
